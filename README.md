# The Bridge Framework Docs

This repository contains the docs for the framework. It's written in Markdown, which is built
and deployed to [dart-bridge.github.io/docs](https://dart-bridge.github.io/docs), which is then
used in the documentation site over at [dart-bridge.io](http://dart-bridge.io).

File issues to this repo if associated with undocumented behaviour, or submit pull requests
to contribute to the documentation source.
